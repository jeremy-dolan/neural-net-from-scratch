## Neural Net From Scratch

Machine learning frameworks, with some demo applications and analysis.

* [mlp_framework_vanilla.py](mlp_framework_vanilla.py) - Complete feedforward
  neural network framework, written in vanilla Python for educational purposes.
  It is well commented and wildly inefficient. ðŸ™ƒ

<!--
* [neural_net_numpy.py](neural_net_numpy.py) - Complete feedforward neural network
  framework, written with NumPy. It is mildly inefficient.
-->

* _MLP notebook:_
  [XOR and linear separability](mlp_demo_xor_and_linear_separability.ipynb) -
  This notebook discusses the XOR function and linear separability. We
  construct a multi-layer perceptron that learns XOR, and then analyze the
  trained network and graph its decision boundaries.

<!--
* [minst-net](3layer-minst-net.ipynb) - This notebook builds a digit classifier
  using the MNIST dataset. WIP.
