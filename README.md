## Neural Net From Scratch

Machine learning frameworks, with some demo applications and analysis.

* [mlp_framework_vanilla.py](mlp_framework_vanilla.py) - Complete multilayer
  perceptron neural network framework, written in vanilla Python for
  educational purposes. It is well commented and wildly inefficient. ðŸ™ƒ
    * _Demo:_
      [XOR and linear separability](mlp_demo_xor_and_linear_separability.ipynb) -
      This notebook discusses the XOR function and linear separability. We
      construct a multi-layer perceptron that learns XOR, and then analyze the
      trained network and graph its decision boundaries.
    * _Demo:_ [Digit classifier](mlp_demo_digit_classifier.ipynb) - This
      notebook trains a multi-class digit classifier using the MNIST dataset,
      and features a couple of interesting visualizations. Planned addition: an
      interactive ipynb widget for drawing digits with real-time visualization
      of the predicted probability distribution.
